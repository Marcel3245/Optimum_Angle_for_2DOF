# Optimum_Angle_for_2DOF
This MATLAB code is designed for a two-link robot leg, aiming to determine the optimal angle between the ground and the 'calf' for achieving a stable standing position. By leveraging mathematical computations, the code iterates through various angles to find the most suitable configuration, ensuring the robot maintains balance and stability."
